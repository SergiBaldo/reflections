What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A new .git folder is created. We need do this for create a tracking on the files of the project and then upload it to the cload.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Is a "place" between the repository and work. dir. offers more control and "prepare" the file(s) to be committed
