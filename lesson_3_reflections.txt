When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	If there are some people working on the same project and they need to share the code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	It's better to have a personal control of what you pull. Once it's finished, then, pull it up to the server.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is a kind of clone but in the cloud (GitHub). Clone is a copy of a project from server to local or local to local and branch is variation of of your project, I mean, one you've finished an important part of your code, then you can "explore" alternatives (branch) with no damage to the original node.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can work offline on your project.
